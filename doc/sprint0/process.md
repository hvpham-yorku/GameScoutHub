How did our team work together ?
Since our team does not have many people, it is easy for us to agree on ideas and recommendations. We do not have to argue too much on simple things

How did you organize the team? Which tools did you use, if any?

We divided tasks based on individual strengths and preferences. Each team member took responsibility for different components of the project. If there is any problem, they can discuss it on the Discord server and solve the problem as soon as possible.

Roles:

Team member name - Roles
Thanh Phat Lam - Project Manager / Full-stack Developer
(Haadi) Abdulhaadi Memisevid - Frontend Developer
Alp Sirek - Backend Developer

Since we only have 3 members, some members are carrying more than one role.
Thanh Phat Lam will be responsible for managing the project as well as developing the features. His strengths include backend development (ExpressJs, NodeJs, MongDB). His weaknesses are UX/UI and frontend development
Alp Sirek will be responsible for Backend development. He has experience with Backend development process
(Haadi) Abdulhaadi Memisevid will be responsible for front-end development. He has been working in Full-stack projects, focusing more on frontend.

Tool: We use Discord for communication, Trello for task management, Github for version/ features control, Google Docs for collaborative documentation. Meeting is conducted in the Discord server

How did you make decisions?

We used a consensus-based approach for most decisions, where we discussed the pros and cons of each option. In cases of disagreement, we would vote or seek guidance from the team leader to break the tie. We also held regular retrospectives to review past decisions and assess their impact.

How did you define priority and/or points of user stories? How many rounds of voting
(on average) did you need to come to a consensus for the point estimate?

Priority : We prioritise user stories based on business value and technical complexity. We used a weighted scoring system to decide which features or fixes were most urgent.
Voting: On average, we needed 1-2 rounds of voting to reach a consensus, as most team members had similar understandings of the complexity.

How frequently did you meet?

We held meetings every 2 days to keep track of the progress and blockers, usually 15-30 minutes. In addition, there was a 1-hour meeting at the weekend to present features, current problems and solutions. This helps align on goals and reflect on the project deadline.

What lessons should you take forward to the next phase?

Improve communication: While we communicated effectively on technical matters, there were moments when requirements weren’t clearly defined upfront. In future phases, we should aim for even more detailed documentation and earlier clarification of requirements.
Flexibility in planning: We found that flexibility in the sprint plans was key to adapting to unforeseen challenges, so we’ll continue to leave room for flexibility in future sprints.
Collaborative feedback: More frequent peer reviews and pair programming could have helped identify potential issues earlier in the process. We will try to integrate this more consistently going forward.
Timeboxing: Some of our meetings could be more timeboxed to avoid extended discussions on smaller issues. We’ll implement stricter time limits to ensure we stay focused.
