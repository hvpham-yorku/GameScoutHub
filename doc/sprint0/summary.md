Objective: To create a tool in which the user can find games off of the biggest digital game distribution platform based on their personal preferences, interests as well as to notify those users in case of sales where their preferences are saved and used to adjust further recommendations. 

Currently when searched forums, there are many comments such as “Yeah, the discovery queue rarely shows me anything I'm interested in, for exactly that reason. I'm more interested in overlooked gems than big, popular hits.”, specifically a reddit user commented this by the name of @alanwithtea (Reference: https://www.reddit.com/r/patientgamers”) 

This is a major issue when it comes to a very large community looking for games of their interest where the number of games that are “findable” with minimal search is very little as just a very small number of games is recommended by most of the members of the community. 

Our tool is aimed to change this experience of the users with limited time or the one’s with the need for efficiency when it comes to finding games.

Key user persona examples: Alex, Mingwa


Alex:
	Key Goals:
 
* Alex needs recommendations that will match his specific needs when it comes to games.
* Alex is looking for unconventional games where the popularity of the game is not an issue but the quality and the uniqueness is important. 
* Alex needs to be able to find games without an overwhelming amount of games on his list.   
	Key Usage Scenarios  
* Alex is not interested in most of the new popular games that have been released, they are looking for a new game but most games that are recommended using steam’s algorithm or forums are based on the popularity of the released games. Their selection of games have also been towards the shorter side when it comes to gameplay time. As of currently, the number of new games that were released were on the lower side, within the existing database they knew they could find a game that would satisfy them but the overwhelming amount of research to be done made it impossible for Alex to find a new game. They are then recommended to a new tool that allows for faster search of games with a detailed description and explanation by the users of the tool as well. This allows them to skip all the time that could have been spent on third party forums and steam recommendations of endless lists of games that prioritise popularity and very general preference parameters over personal preferences. 

	
Mingwa:  
	Key Goals:  
 
* Finding games with developers focusing on the competitive ranking system and a strong community 
* A matchmaking system that is sophisticated enough to eliminate factors such as “smurfing” that focuses on fair matchmaking
* Finding games with a leaderboard system that is able to divide and reflect one's abilities within a balanced metric system that is consistent.  

	Key Scenarios:  
* Mingwa values their competitive experience where when they are queued in a game, it is ensured by the game’s company that they will be queued in a game where the match that is taking place feels very balanced. A more detailed explanation would be that the game’s result of victory or loss is as close as it can be for either of the side where the players within their respective abilities are given a win with the smallest of parameters are in control and the game feels very close every single time that Mingwa is in a game. This will drive the competitive feeling to a better state for them and the chance of winning is not felt as if there is a “coin flip”  This also means that they want to find a game where the competitive integrity is prioritised over anything, this includes balancing of characters and skills etc. 
			
Recognition of toxic communities are also extremely important where this preference is recognized by the system or reported by the community of the users -of the tool. 
After the result of a very unenjoyable experience of gaming, Mingwa wants to find a game within her need out of a competitive game but also does not want to change her genre of gaming which where they input all these preferences in including a large community with lower levels of toxicity. 


Key Scenario Explanation:  
	The key scenarios touch upon frustrations and situations that could be potentially faced by our personas specifically created with the purpose of where this tool would be used and be the best choice over any other solution. This allows us to focus on the potential needs and features that our users might benefit from. For Alex, the time constraint and the poor selection algorithms used by large distribution companies are the focus. This is due to these companies prioritising not the needs of the users, but capitalist goals whether that be advertising etc. or simply the popularity of newly released games which result in a long search for a game that has a high probability of having a short gameplay time. Our tool recognizes those issues and focuses on fast delivery of recommendations. 
	For Mingwa, her taste in games is a bit more general yet her needs in those games are very specific. Our tool is designed to be the solution to this problem by finding a game that has a large community support, and using those parameters to adapt our recommendation algorithm, aiming to decrease the time needed to find the perfect games. 

Key Use Cases (generalised):

* Help gamers find games based on personal preference, including genre, platform, playstyle
* Regularly update and suggest games based on users’ evolving preferences or recent game releases
